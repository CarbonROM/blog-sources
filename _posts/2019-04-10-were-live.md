The time has finally come, we're going official.

After Server issues, and several rebases due to Google's Upstream doing the same, we're finally satisfied with the ROM to make it officially available to the public.

The new CarbonROM revision 7.0 is codenamed Opal, and is currently based on android-9.0.0_r35 (thats the April security bulletin).

As always, you can find the builds on [https://get.carbonrom.org/](https://get.carbonrom.org/). The Unofficial XDA threads have been updated to reflect the new download links and information. Please note that due to custom signature Keys you MUST perform a clean install when moving from an Unofficial to an Official build.

Also it is recommended that you perform a clean install when coming from Noct. Whereas some devices were tested to perform an upgrade to Opal sucessfully, some where also discovered to require a clean install. That mainly affects devices using Full Disk Encryption (like the Nexus 6 and Xiaomi Redmi Note 4) because the encryption code had some major changes in Pie (actually it was removed by Google and readded by CAF).
That means you need to remove your previous encryption (use "Format data" in TWRP) and reencrypt on Pie if you want to do so.

With new features like Aggressive Battery, a newly designed performance vendor, the addition of DUs Theme Engine and many more coming we feel like this might be our best release so far. Let us know what you think.

The initially supported devices are:
* [Essential Phone (mata)](https://get.carbonrom.org/device-mata.html)
* [Google Nexus 6 (shamu)](https://get.carbonrom.org/device-shamu.html)
* [Google Pixel 2 XL (taimen)](https://get.carbonrom.org/device-taimen.html)
* [Google Nexus 4 (mako)](https://get.carbonrom.org/device-mako.html)
* [Lenovo ZUK Z2/Z2 Plus (z2_plus)](https://get.carbonrom.org/device-z2_plus.html)
* [Moto G5 (cedric)](https://get.carbonrom.org/device-cedric.html)
* [OnePlus 3/3T (oneplus3)](https://get.carbonrom.org/device-oneplus3.html)
* [OnePlus 5 (cheeseburger)](https://get.carbonrom.org/device-cheeseburger.html)
* [OnePlus 5T (dumpling)](https://get.carbonrom.org/device-dumpling.html)
* [OnePlus 6 (enchilada)](https://get.carbonrom.org/device-enchilada.html)
* [Sony Xperia Z1 (honami)](https://get.carbonrom.org/device-honami.html)
* [Xiaomi Poco F1 (beryllium)](https://get.carbonrom.org/device-beryllium.html)
* [Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (mido)](https://get.carbonrom.org/device-mido.html)

More devices will come at further releases, some of them even as soon as next week.

Also, this is the first time ever we will keep on maintaining the older branch. That means you will still get monthly security updates of Noct on the devices that do not support Pie yet.

For now, Happy flashing and we hope you'll enjoy the ROM as much as we did creating it!

P.S: This is also the first release that is officially lead by Christian. Patrick and Ryan put down their duty as Project Leads. We're wishing them the best on their further endavours ;)
