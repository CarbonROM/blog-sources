title: August ASB, new devices and new features
---

Most of you already got the update and some already discovered the new changes. For those that didn't yet, here is what to look out for.

The latest weeklys feature the [August Security Patches](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2019-08-01.html) based on android-9.0.0_r46 and we've added lockscreen weather! You can enable it in CarbonFibers.

Also, thanks to newly joined team members we were able to extend our list of supported devices.
We're happy to welcome back the [Samsung Galaxy S2](https://get.carbonrom.org/device-i9100.html) (yes, that think that released with Gingerbread back in 2011) and the [Xiaomi Redmi Note 5](https://get.carbonrom.org/device-whyred.html).

Lastly, an announcement for all OnePlus 3/3T users: Starting with the latest Weekly you will need to use the latest Pie firmware from OnePlus. For help, you can check on how to do that [here](*STILL NEEDS URL*).
