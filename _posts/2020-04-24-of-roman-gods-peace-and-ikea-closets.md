We are proud to say, that PAX is by far the most complete and unique release of CarbonROM we had so far. New features have been introduced and existing features have been polished to match our standards. That means, for example, that custom battery styles have been rewritten in Kotlin to fit the Android 10 codestyle while keeping and extending their features from Android 9.

We also brought back custom fonts as you know them. The included fonts as well as font packages created on [fonts.carbonrom.org](https://fonts.carbonrom.org) can be applied systemwide, including on userapps. That means browsing reddit with Comic Sans MS is no longer a problem ;)

All of this would not have been possible without the contributions of all our team members. Which brings us to the next topic:
# Carbon is growing!
Starting with Android 10, the CarbonROM Team will be joined by the former team of AquariOS. We've been working together in the past already, and with them joining the team we look forward to making CarbonROM even greater! We'd also like to welcome our new maintainers and me2151, who claims to do nothing but is a great addition to the core team!
